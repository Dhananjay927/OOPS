        "#OOPS Assignment\n",
        "##Theory Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1- What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style where you structure your code using objects.Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world concepts like inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function\n",
        "\n",
        "2- What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behaviors) that the objects will have. Objects created from a class share the same structure but can hold different values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3- What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in OOP is an instance of a class—meaning it is a real, usable thing created from the class blueprint. It contains actual data and can perform actions defined in the class. Each object can have different values for the same attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4- What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- 1. Abstraction\n",
        "  - Abstraction means showing only the essential features of an object and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "  - It helps you focus on what a method or object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "  - It reduces complexity by exposing only a simple interface to the user.\n",
        "- Encapsulation\n",
        "  - Encapsulation means binding data and methods together inside a class.\n",
        "  - It also protects data from unauthorized access using private or protected variables.\n",
        "  - It helps control how the internal data is accessed or modified (using getters/setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "5- What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERscore methods) are special built-in methods in Python whose names start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __add__, etc.\n",
        "They allow you to define how your objects should behave with built-in operations (such as printing, adding, comparing, iterating).\n",
        "These methods are automatically called by Python, not manually.\n",
        "They make classes more powerful and allow custom objects to behave like built-in types.\n",
        "\n",
        "6- Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS.\n",
        "- Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism that allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "It helps in reusing code, reducing duplication, and building relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7- What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in OOP means one method name behaving differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "It allows different classes to have a method with the same name but different implementations.\n",
        "- It happens in two ways: Method overriding and Method overloading\n",
        "\n",
        "8- How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to variables and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "- this is mainly done using:<br>\n",
        "  1. Private Variables: Prefixing a variable with double underscore makes it private and not directly accessible outside the class.\n",
        "  2. Getter and Setter Methods: These methods safely read and modify private data.\n",
        "  3. Using Classes to Bundle Data + Methods: Encapsulation is also achieved simply by placing attributes and methods inside a class.\n",
        "  4. Protected variables: Prefixing a variable with single underscore makes it protected and only accessible inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9- What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is created.\n",
        "It automatically runs whenever you create an object and is mainly used to set up initial values for attributes.\n",
        "In Python, the constructor is the method named __init__().\n",
        "\n",
        "10- What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or\n",
        "modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the\n",
        "@classmethod decorator.\n",
        "- Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11- What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "- However, Python does NOT support true method overloading like Java or C++. If you define the same method name multiple times, the last one overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "- Similar behavior like method overloading is achieved using default parameters or *argsin Python. This makes methods flexible and able to handle different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12- What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in OOP occurs when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class. It allows the subclass to modify or completely replace the parent’s behavior.\n",
        "- This supports runtime polymorphism, where the method that gets executed depends on the object type. It helps in customizing behavior while still using inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "13- What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A property decorator (@property) in Python is used to turn a method into an attribute, allowing you to access it like a variable while still controlling the logic behind it.\n",
        "It helps implement encapsulation by providing getter, setter, and deleter methods with clean syntax.\n",
        "- it is useful because:<br>\n",
        "  - You can compute or validate values while accessing them like normal attributes.\n",
        "  - It hides method calls and makes code cleaner.\n",
        "- Example:<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class Person:<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, age):<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self._age = age<br>\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@property<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def age(self):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# getter<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return self._age<br>\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@age.setter<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def age(self, value):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# setter<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if value > 0:<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self._age = value\n",
        "\n",
        "14- Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it makes programs more flexible, reusable, and easier to extend.\n",
        "- It allows the same method name to work differently depending on the object, so you can write general code that works for many types of objects. This reduces duplication and makes it easier to add new classes without changing existing code.\n",
        "- It also supports runtime flexibility, where the correct method is chosen based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "15-  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "- It can contain abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented) that must be implemented by the child classes.\n",
        "Abstract classes help enforce a structure and ensure subclasses follow a required pattern.\n",
        "- An Python, abstract classes are created using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16-  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Here are the main advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "  1. **Reusability**: You can reuse code by creating classes and using inheritance. This avoids writing the same code again and again.\n",
        "  2. **Modularity**: OOP breaks a big program into small, manageable pieces (classes/objects). This makes code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "  3. **Flexibility (Polymorphism)**: The same method name can work differently for different objects. This makes programs more flexible and easy to extend.\n",
        "  4. **Data Security (Encapsulation)**: Data can be protected using private variables and controlled access. This prevents accidental or unauthorized modification.\n",
        "  5. **Easy to Maintain and Modify**: Since code is organized into classes, making changes becomes safer and simpler.\n",
        "  6. **Real-World Mapping**: OOP models real-world entities, making problem-solving more natural and intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "17- What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "1. Class Variable\n",
        "  - Shared by all objects of the class.\n",
        "  - Defined inside the class, but outside any method.\n",
        "  - Changing it affects every object.\n",
        "2. Instance Variable\n",
        "  - Unique to each object.\n",
        "  - Defined inside the constructor (__init__) or inside any method using self.\n",
        "  - Changing it affects only that specific object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18- What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to combine features (methods and attributes) from multiple classes.\n",
        "- Python fully supports multiple inheritance, but it must be used carefully to avoid confusion when parents have the same method names (handled by MRO - Method Resolution Order).\n",
        "\n",
        "19- Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' (dunder methods) methods in Python.\n",
        "1. Purpose of __str__:<br>\n",
        "    - __str__ defines the human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "    - It is meant for end users and should be friendly and easy to understand.\n",
        "    - It is called when you use print(obj) or str(obj).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Purpose of __repr__:<br>\n",
        "    - __repr__ defines the official or developer-friendly representation of an object.\n",
        "    - It should ideally return a string that can re-create the object (or at least describe it precisely).\n",
        "    - It is used in debugging and when you type the object in the Python shell.\n",
        "\n",
        "20-  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods of the parent class from a child class.\n",
        "- It helps reuse parent class code and is useful when overriding methods.\n",
        "- super() also avoids hard-coding the parent class name and works well with multiple inheritance.\n",
        "- Example:<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class A:<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def show(self):<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(\"This is class A\")<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class B(A):<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def show(self):<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super().show()  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# calling parent class method<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(\"This is class B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "21- What is the significance of the __del__(dunder method) method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. Its main purpose is to perform cleanup tasks when an object is about to be destroyed (for example, closing files or releasing resources).\n",
        "- It is automatically invoked when the object is no longer needed or the program ends. However, its use is rare because Python already manages memory automatically through garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "22- What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        "  - Does not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "  - It behaves like a normal function inside a class.\n",
        "  - It cannot access class variables or instance variables directly.\n",
        "  - Used when the method logic is related to the class but doesn’t need class data.\n",
        "- @classmethod\n",
        "  - Takes cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "  - Can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "  - Called using the class name and is useful for creating alternative constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "23- How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python allows different classes to provide different implementations of the same method. When inheritance is used, a child class can override a method from the parent class with its own version.\n",
        "- When you call that method on an object, Python decides which version to use based on the object's actual class, not the variable type. This is known as **dynamic method dispatch**. It makes code flexible — you write one piece of code that works with many object types.\n",
        "- Example: both 'Dog' and 'Cat' can override the 'speak()' method of 'Animal'.\n",
        "\n",
        "24- What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python OOP means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, one after another. This works when each method returns the object itself (return self), allowing the next method to be called immediately.\n",
        "- Need of method chaining:\n",
        "    - Cleaner and shorter code — avoids writing the object name again and again.\n",
        "    - Fluent interface — methods read like a sequence of actions.\n",
        "    - Better readability — code looks like natural English instructions.\n",
        "    - Useful when performing multiple operations on the same object.\n",
        "    - Common in builders, data transformations, and configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "25- What is the purpose of the __call__ (dunder) method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python lets an object behave like a function.\n",
        "- If a class defines __call__, then its object can be called using parentheses — just like calling a function.\n",
        "- Need:\n",
        "    - To make objects work like functions\n",
        "    - For creating configurable functions (e.g., machine learning models, counters, validators)\n",
        "    - For cleaner and more readable APIs\n",
        "- Example:<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class Greeter:<br>\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __call__(self, name):<br>\n",
